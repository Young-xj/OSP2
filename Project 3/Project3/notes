When your do_dispatch()is invoked, 

after checking whether there was a thread running 
(and calculating how much time is remaining for that thread by taking the difference of the current time, HClock.get() and the lastDispatch time of that thread), 


you will check the ready queue to see if there is a thread that has a shorter remaining burst time. 

If the remaining burst time for the current thread is as short or shorter than the estimated burst time of the threads in the ready queue 
	then continue with the current thread and return SUCCESS. 

	If if the current burst of the current thread is less than 2 milliseconds, 
		then continue with the current thread. 
		Do not change the value of lastDispatch since you are continuing to run the current thread. 

Else
	preempt the current thread and dispatch the thread in the ready queue with the shortest estimated burst time
	and return SUCCESS. 
	Be sure to update lastDispatch for this new thread. 

If there is no current thread running and no threads are available in the ready queue 
	then set PTBR=NULL and return FAILURE.
